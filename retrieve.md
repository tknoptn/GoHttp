Retrieving Employee Data from an API

demonstrates to retrieve employee data and decode the JSON response.

Importing the packages needed to make the API call and decode the JSON response.

The employee data is stored in a Employee struct, 
and multiple Employee structs are stored in an  Employees struct.

The code then makes an API call to retrieve the employee data, and decodes the JSON response.
Finally, the code loops through the Employee structs and prints out the employee data.
